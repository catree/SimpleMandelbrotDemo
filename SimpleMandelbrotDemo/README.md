SimpleMandelbrotDemo
====================

# Goal of this project
SimpleMandelbrotDemo is a project I started as a training project to practice Java programming and to learn different concepts (multithreading, Swing gui) with a problematic of my choice.
At the time of writing, mostly all the features I wanted to implement is coded with some basic tests executed. Further improvement, bug correction or fully advanced tests may / will be added / done.

# Overview 
This application is coded in Java (Java 7) and after some computation displays a Mandelbrot set.

# Features
Main features :
- compute and display a fractal / Mandelbrot set with different colors
- use different multithreading methods / approaches to do the computation
- let the user to modify different options as the number of threads to use or the image size
- possibility to zoom or unzoom a particular region by drawing a rectangular selection with the mouse
- in case of zoom, the new image is computed with the new parameters
- possibility to save an image
- benchmark dialog to do some tests
